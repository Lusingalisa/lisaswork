    "- A graph is a collecton of nodes and edges where edges connect nodes while trees are a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges with a single root node.\n",

    "- weighted vs unweighted\n",
    "  - A weighted graph is one where each edge has numerical values assigned to it called a weight representing additional information like distance while an unweighted graph does not have weights on its edges, simply indicating whether a connection exists between two nodes without any associated value."
